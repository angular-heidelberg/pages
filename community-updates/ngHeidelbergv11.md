## ℹ️ News

### The State of Angular

There were some uncertainties and emotional statements __on social media__ about the Angular Core Team's work safety and health and the Angular framework itself. Stephen Fluin commented on these issues in ["The Angular Show E20"](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2zn7uTeNTHVjmGVsg5HDnb).

Summary: There was already a change in the management structure earlier this year. They are very concerned about the welfare of each employee and there will definitely be __a new roadmap very soon__. However, no one from the Angular team will comment on internal affairs or former employees and will not directly respond via social media.

### Angular 10 

There are very few new [features](https://blog.angular.io/version-10-of-angular-now-available-78960babd41) in this version, but many fixes.

### AngularJS LTS

The LTS phase of the legacy AngularJS framework was [extended for another 6 months](https://twitter.com/angular/status/1287780634572857357) due to COVID-19. However, now one should really, really migrate!
