   - KeyValuePipe
   - new (still experimental) ivy features
1. TypeScript 3.0 RC is out
   - not yet supported by Angular right now!

   - New `unknown` top type (a type-safe counterpart of `any`)
   - only a few minor breaking changes

   You should enable 2FA for your npm accounts!
   
   You can run this, Look for "3.7.2" in the output :skull_and_crossbones:
   ```
   cd ~/code
   find . -type d -name "eslint-scope" -print0 | xargs -n 1 -0 -I % sh -c "(cat %/package.json | npx json version) && echo '(at %)'"
   ```
